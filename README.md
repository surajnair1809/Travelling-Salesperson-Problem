# Travelling-Salesperson-Problem

The travelling salesman problem (also called the traveling salesperson problemor TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.

The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations of TSP.
